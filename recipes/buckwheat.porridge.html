    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Buckwheat is a nutrient-rich, gluten-free seed with a mild nutty flavor.
         When boiled into porridge, it becomes a hearty, versatile dish that pairs well with savory meals.
         I especially enjoy it at lunchtime or dinner, as its filling, wholesome, and easy to prepare.
         Delicious buckwheat porridge can be made both in the oven and on the stove. Here is a stovetop version.</em></strong></p>
         <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><strong><em>2 dl buckwheat groats</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>5 dl boiling water</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>0.25 tsp salt</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>1-2 tbsp butter</em></strong></li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps:</h2>
         <h3>Step 1:</h3>
         <p><strong><em>Heat the buckwheat for 3-4 minutes in butter</em></strong></p>
         <h3>Step 2:</h3>
         <p><strong><em>Add hot water and simmer under a lid over low heat for 15-20 minutes,
         until the liquid is absorbed and the buckwheat is cooked. Add salt halfway through cooking.</em></strong></p>
         <h3>Tips and Recommendations:</h3>
         <p><strong><em>Tips and recommendations:
        Buckwheat porridge is also a good side dish for lamb or beef ragout, for example.
        Cold buckwheat porridge is very tasty fried in butter.
        For a vegan version, fry the buckwheat in oil. </em></strong></p>
